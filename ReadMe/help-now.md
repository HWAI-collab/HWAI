### AI-Enhanced Emergency Response Framework

```javascript
// Core AI-enhanced emergency response service
class IntelligentEmergencyManager {
  constructor() {
    this.crisisAssessmentEngine = new CrisisAssessmentAnalyzer()
    this.resourceAllocationService = new AIResourceAllocator()
    this.responseCoordinationService = new ResponseCoordinationEngine()
    this.communicationAnalyzer = new CommunicationAnalysisEngine()
  }
  
  async assessEmergencySituation(emergencyData, contextualInformation) {
    const situationAnalysis = await this.crisisAssessmentEngine.analyzeSituation({
      emergency_type: emergencyData.emergency_type,
      affected_area: emergencyData.geographic_scope,
      population_impact: emergencyData.population_affected,
      infrastructure_damage: emergencyData.infrastructure_assessment,
      environmental_factors: contextualInformation.environmental_conditions
    })
    
    return {
      situation_assessment: situationAnalysis,
      resource_requirements: await this.calculateResourceNeeds(situationAnalysis),
      response_strategy: await this.generateResponseStrategy(situationAnalysis),
      coordination_plan: await this.generateCoordinationPlan(situationAnalysis)
    }
  }
}
```
