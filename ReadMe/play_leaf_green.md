## Abstract

The Pokemon AI Agent represents an advanced autonomous game-playing system that combines high-performance Rust for emulator interaction and memory management with Python's rich AI ecosystem for decision-making. This system demonstrates sophisticated memory-driven intelligence where game state is persistently tracked in a database, creating a contextual "diary" of the AI's experiences. The agent employs DeepSeek's advanced language models for strategic decision-making while maintaining the 250 most recent memories to inform future actions.

The architecture features a dual-language approach: Rust handles low-level memory reading, emulator control, and real-time input injection through RetroArch, while Python orchestrates the AI decision pipeline, database management, and LLM integration. This hybrid design achieves sub-100ms response times for game actions while maintaining sophisticated contextual understanding through screenshot-based OCR, pathfinding algorithms, and adaptive learning from action success/failure patterns. The system advances the field of AI game agents by demonstrating that modern LLMs can effectively play complex RPGs when provided with structured memory and context management.

### AI Integration Framework

The AI integration implements a sophisticated pipeline:

1. **Memory Reading**: Rust component extracts game state from RetroArch memory
2. **Context Assembly**: Combining current state with 250 recent memories from database
3. **Multimodal Processing**: OCR for text, screenshots for visual context, memory for state
4. **LLM Decision**: DeepSeek processes structured data with frequency/presence penalties
5. **Adaptive Execution**: Action execution with success/failure tracking for learning

### Memory Management Pipeline

```rust
// Rust memory reading implementation
use retroarch_memory::Memory;

pub struct GameMemory {
    memory: Memory,
    base_offset: usize,
}

impl GameMemory {
    pub fn read_player_position(&self) -> (u16, u16) {
        let x = self.memory.read_u16(0x02025734);
        let y = self.memory.read_u16(0x02025736);
        (x, y)
    }
    
    pub fn extract_map_data(&self) -> MapData {
        // Extract walkable tiles for pathfinding
        self.memory.read_map_structure(0x02025740)
    }
}
```

```python
# Python memory database
class ExperienceMemory:
    def __init__(self, db_path="game_memory.db"):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        self.memory_limit = 250
    
    def store_experience(self, state, action, success):
        """Store game experience as contextual diary entry"""
        self.conn.execute(
            "INSERT INTO memories (state, action, success, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
            (json.dumps(state), action, success, datetime.now())
        )
        self.trim_old_memories()
    
    def get_recent_context(self):
        """Retrieve 250 most recent memories for LLM context"""
        return self.conn.execute(
            "SELECT * FROM memories ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT ?",
            (self.memory_limit,)
        ).fetchall()
```
