## Abstract

OrthoVision represents a pioneering artificial intelligence platform designed to revolutionise orthopaedic diagnostic workflows through the integration of advanced computer vision, natural language processing, and generative machine learning technologies. The system comprises three distinct AI-powered modules: HorusAI for intelligent clinical consultation, HarrierX for automated diagnostic measurement and analysis, and LammerGAN for synthetic medical image generation. This comprehensive suite addresses critical challenges in orthopaedic practice, including diagnostic accuracy, educational resource availability, and clinical decision support, whilst positioning itself as an essential tool for reducing physician cognitive load and enhancing patient outcomes.

The platform leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including transformer-based language models for medical consultation, object detection networks for anatomical feature identification, and generative adversarial networks for synthetic radiographic image creation. Through its modular design and robust API infrastructure, OrthoVision provides scalable solutions for both clinical deployment and medical education environments.
